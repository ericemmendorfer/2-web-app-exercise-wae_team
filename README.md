# Web Application Exercise

A little exercise to build a web application following an agile development process. See the [instructions](instructions.md) for more detail.

## Product vision statement

The vision for this project is to create the Assignment Manager web app that we designed from last project, which the user can use it to manage the assignments they need to do in the future by setting up reminders on their timeline and also calculate their grade based on weights anytime they want conveniently.

## User stories

1. "As a student, I want to be able to easily set up reminders for upcoming assignments with details from multiple classes so that I will get reminded when it's time."
2. "As a student, I want to be able to view the details of an assignment reminder I've added previously and be able to edit it easily so that I can manage all of them conveniently."
3. "As a student, I want to be able to directly see the reminders that I've set up for the assignments displayed somewhere so that I won't forget about them."
4. "As a student, I want to see the reminders I've set up for the assignments in a calendar view so it will be more direct to have an overview of future weeks."
5. "As a student, I want to easily see the grades of my classes anytime during the semester so that I won't have the need to calculate them myself nor need to wait for the class to finish in order to get my grade."
6. "As a student, I want to be able to adjust weights of different tasks for a class so that I can adapt my grade calculating to unexpected changes if there happens to be one."
